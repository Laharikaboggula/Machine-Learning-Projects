TI recently completed a House Price Prediction project where I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on real-world data. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

🔹 Dataset Used

California Housing Dataset

Features include location-based attributes, population, median income, and housing characteristics

🔹 Project Workflow
✔ Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations

Used visualization techniques like scatter plots and correlation analysis

✔ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using SimpleImputer

Performed feature selection and data cleaning

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split

✔ Model Building

Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn

Trained the model on processed data to learn patterns affecting house prices

✔ Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Applied cross-validation to ensure model reliability and reduce overfitting

🔹 Key Learnings
✨ Importance of data preprocessing in ML projects
✨ How feature relationships impact prediction accuracy
✨ Practical experience with model evaluation metrics
✨ Building a complete ML workflow from scratch

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

This project gave me hands-on exposure to applying machine learning concepts to a real-world problem and strengthened my foundation in data analysis and predictive modeling.

📌 I’m excited to keep learning and building more ML projects!
